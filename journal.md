Trump was the one to start this ban back in 2020 for the same resaon it got banned last week... for suspision of china stealing users data. the U.S. Supremem court said there was no reason of the ban that it was china. they stated the ban was put in place because of the susupion of data stealing... not beacsue its a chinese company or not bc the U.S. makes no money off the app.
